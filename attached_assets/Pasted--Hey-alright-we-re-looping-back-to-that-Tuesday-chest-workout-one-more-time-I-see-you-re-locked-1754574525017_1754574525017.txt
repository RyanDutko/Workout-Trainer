
Hey, alright, we're looping back to that Tuesday chest workout one more time – I see you're locked in on tweaking it to perfection, and that's the kind of focus that drives real progress. We've unpacked the bench, inclines, flyes, cables, dips, skull crushers, and pushdowns in our past chats, so let's shift gears to some progression tips based on what you logged. I'm pulling from your exact data here: Flat Bench Press at 3x8@185lbs (solid reps, no drops), Incline Dumbbell Press at 3x10@70lbs (clean form throughout), Pec Dec Fly at 3x12@120lbs, Cable Crossover at 3x12@40lbs per side, Dips at 3x10 bodyweight, Skull Crushers at 3x12@50lbs, and Tricep Pushdowns at 3x15@60lbs. Here's what jumps out for next time – these are straight progression notes to build on your performance: - For Flat Bench Press: You've been nailing 185lbs consistently; bump to 190lbs for your next session and aim to keep those 8 reps per set. Your form held up great, so this should push hypertrophy without risking breakdown. - For Incline Dumbbell Press: 70lbs is feeling smooth – try 75lbs and drop to 3x8 if needed to maintain control. This'll hit the upper chest harder based on how steady you were. - For Pec Dec Fly: 120lbs for clean 12s? Killer. Progress to 130lbs and focus on that slow eccentric to amp up the stretch – you've got the stability for it. - For Cable Crossover: 40lbs per side is solid, but let's add a drop set on the last round (like 40 to 30) to fry those inner pecs more, since your reps didn't falter. - For Dips: Bodyweight 3x10 is strong; add a 10lb plate if you've got a belt, or slow the negatives to 4 seconds for extra time under tension. - For Skull Crushers: 50lbs for 12s is on point – up it to 55lbs and keep the elbows tight; your control here screams readiness for more load. - For Tricep Pushdowns: 60lbs at 15 reps? Beast mode. Go to 65lbs and chase 12-15 to build on that pump without losing form. These tweaks are all about gradual overload from what you crushed this week. Hit me with how that lands or if you want to adjust any specifics – ready to refine further?
